Built using [Rust][]. It stores it's data in a directory of plain text files.
Data synchronization is acheived with [Syncthing][].

- `augr` is designed for my own use, and I use it almost everyday
- Rust's strong static type system reduces the number of bugs
- Realized that a simpler format would serve `augr`'s purposes better
