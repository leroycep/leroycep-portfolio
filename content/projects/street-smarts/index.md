I worked on Street Smarts as a Fullstack Web Developer.

We used Node and Express on the backend.

On the Frontend we used React.

- Street Smarts gives the user estimates of the cost and carbon emissions of a selected car
- Created a backend that pulled data from Postgres and another REST API
- Implemented custom SVG widget to display carbon emissions
- Pair programmed with other developers
