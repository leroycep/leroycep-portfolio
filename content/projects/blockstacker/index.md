I worked on this project as part of a two person team. The game was built using [Zig][] and [seizer][].

- Ported Blockstacker to run on the web via WebGL and WASM
- Ported to run on the RG351, a handheld gaming device
- Setup continuous integration to deploy master branch to web
- Created menu screens (main menu, pause, etc.)
