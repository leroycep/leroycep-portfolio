I built this project using [Zig][] and the [zig-gamekit][] project.

- Implements Gli≈Ñski's hexagonal chess variant
- Play with a friend! I added multiplayer using TCP connections to let you play across the internet.
- Contributed to the zig-gamekit library, adding functions to the Vec type and support for text input
- Implemented text rendering using the [AngelCode font format](angelcode)
